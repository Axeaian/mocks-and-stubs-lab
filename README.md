# Lab: Mocks and stubs with `jest`

In this lab, the code for a payments processor has been implemented, and your task is to write tests for each function:
- `paymentService.js`
- `main.js`
- `queueService.js`
(you can do it in this order if you want to start with simpler tests before moving to harder tests)

**IMPORTANT**: not all functions will require mocking! If the function has a dependency on something from another file/library, mock that dependency. Otherwise, just test it like how you've been unit-testing functions

### Getting started
- Fork and clone repo
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- cd into project directory
- Run tests: `npm run test:watch`
